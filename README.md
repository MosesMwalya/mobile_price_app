# Empowering Agile Marketing with Data-Driven Insights: My Mobile Phone Price Prediction Project.

My organization decided to venture into mobile phone business as a way of extending our product portfolio in our expansion plan. We worked on all aspects of marketing but one challenge remained unresolved! - how do we price our product considering that we always strive to price optimally; underpricing or overpricing is a risk we never consider

The main goal of the project is therefore to develop a model that gives ideal price given a set of product characteristics.
## Objectives
1. Firstly, seek to understand mobile phone device ecosystem by 
    - Identifying characteristics of mobile features in the market
    -  And then establishing any relationship between features of a mobile phone and its selling price. 

    
2. Secondly, to determine the role the established phone features play in determining their price.

3. Finally, develop and avail a simulation model that our marketers would use to determine ideal mobile price for a given combination of phone features.
