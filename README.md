# Empowering Agile Marketing with Data-Driven Insights: My Mobile Phone Price Prediction Project.

My organization decided to venture into mobile phone business as a way of extending our product portfolio in our expansion plan. We worked on all aspects of marketing but one challenge remained unresolved! - how do we price our product considering that we always strive to price optimally; underpricing or overpricing is a risk we never consider

The main goal of the project is therefore to develop a model that estimates ideal price given a set of product characteristics.
## Objectives
1. Firstly, seek to understand mobile phone device ecosystem by 
    - Identifying characteristics of mobile features in the market
    -  And then establishing any relationship between features of a mobile phone and its selling price. 

    
2. Secondly, to determine the role the phone features play in determining their price.

3. Finally, develop and avail a simulation model that our marketers would use to determine ideal mobile price for a given combination of phone features.

## About Dataset
 *I used fictitious data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ybifoundation/mobile-price-range?select=MobilePriceRange.csv) but I try as much as possible to demonstrate the steps that one can use to generate similar set.*

There are two steps involved:-
1. generating list of features that customers always ask for when buying a mobile phone.
   
   I did immersions with phone sellers and through this process, I was able to generate a list of features that customers consider important when buying phone. The list is as shown

3. Collected quantitative data of mobile phones
   
   Using features identified in Step 1 above, I developed a questionnaire and visited randomly selected phone shop sellers and for each phone that they stocked, recorded the features and corresponding price range. During this exercise, I collected data for 2000 different mobile phones on sale.
